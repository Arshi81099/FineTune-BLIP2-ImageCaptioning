# Fine-Tuning BLIP-2 for Image Captioning Using PEFT

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook to fine-tune the **BLIP-2** model on an image captioning dataset using **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**. This approach allows us to effectively adapt the BLIP-2 model to specific image captioning tasks while minimizing the computational costs associated with full model fine-tuning.

## Project Overview
**BLIP-2** (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) is a state-of-the-art model for vision-language tasks, including image captioning, visual question answering, and more. In this project, we use PEFT to adapt BLIP-2 to a specific image captioning dataset. PEFT allows for efficient fine-tuning by only updating a small subset of model parameters, which is particularly beneficial for large models.

## Dataset
The project requires an image captioning dataset containing pairs of images and their associated captions. Ensure that the dataset is preprocessed and formatted correctly before training.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, you'll need the following libraries:
- `torch`
- `transformers`
- `PEFT` (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning library)
- `PIL` (for image processing)
- Any other libraries as mentioned in the notebook

Use the following command to install the required packages:
```bash
pip install torch transformers peft pillow
```

## Getting Started
1. **Clone this repository** (or download the notebook if working locally).
2. **Set up your dataset**: Place your dataset in the appropriate directory, and ensure it is formatted correctly for image captioning tasks (image-caption pairs).
3. **Configure hyperparameters**: Adjust the hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size) in the notebook to suit your specific dataset and computational resources.

## Training
Run the cells in the Jupyter notebook to start training the model on your image captioning dataset. The notebook provides detailed explanations and step-by-step guidance through the fine-tuning process.

## Results
The notebook will output key metrics and visual examples of the model's performance on the validation/test set. These results can be used to evaluate the quality of the generated captions and model performance.
